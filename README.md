# Weather-Application
<p>I created a weather application that uses the Open Weather API to show a city's current weather as well as a 5 day forcast. The API uses longitude and lattitude to find the geolocation, then pulls current and future weather data. This application saves the user's local storage data for easy reference and repeat searching. </p>
